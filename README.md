# Sample React Project with Email Sending Capabilities

This project covers the fundamentals of React, including components, JSX syntax, state management, props, hooks, and more. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of React.js and be ready to start building powerful, interactive web applications.

It also gives you the ability add an email send function to the previously created contact form. You can view the crash course on this URL:

Since React is JavaScript and does not process emails like server-side code (PHP, Node, etc), we have to make a call to an external location. For this tutorial, we will be using a simple PHP email function that is referenced in the React code using FETCH. This works the same way you would use it for an API. You have to worry about CORS, but if you are accessing the send file on your server, it is less important.

Essentially, you set up a typical PHP send function, and then call it from React. Easy.
